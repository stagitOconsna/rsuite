In this article, we will show you how to install Eviews 8 32-bit patch using a silent installation method. This means that you do not have to interact with any dialog boxes or prompts during the installation process. Instead, you can use a setup.iss file that contains all the necessary information and commands for the patch installation.
 
## Steps to Install Eviews 8 32-bit Patch
 
1. Download the Eviews 8 32-bit patch file (Eviews8Patch\_071113.exe) from the official website[^1^]. Save it to a folder of your choice, such as C:\temp\eviews.
2. Create a setup.iss file using the standard -r switch. To do this, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the patch file. Then type the following command and press Enter: 
`Eviews8Patch_071113.exe -r`
This will run the patch installation in record mode and create a setup.iss file in the same folder.
3. Edit the setup.iss file using a text editor such as Notepad. The file should look something like this:


        [InstallShield Silent]
        Version=v7.00
        File=Response File
        
        [File Transfer]
        OverwrittenReadOnly=NoToAll
        
        [C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-DlgOrder]
        Dlg0=C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-SdWelcome-0
        Count=3
        Dlg1=C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-SdAskDestPath-0
        Dlg2=C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-SdFinish-0
        
        [C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-SdWelcome-0]
        Result=1
        
        [C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-SdAskDestPath-0]
        szDir=C:\Program Files\EViews 8\
        Result=1
        
        [C24A8909-AA26-4CF1-B91D-7D2A1182B927-SdFinish-0]
        Result=1
        bOpt1=0
        bOpt2=0


The setup.iss file contains the information and commands for the patch installation, such as the version, the destination folder, and the options. You can modify these values according to your preferences.
4. Run the patch installation in silent mode using the setup.iss file. To do this, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the patch file and the setup.iss file. Then type the following command and press Enter: 
`Eviews8Patch_071113.exe /f1C:\temp\eviews\setup.iss`
This will run the patch installation without any user interaction, using the information and commands from the setup.iss file. Note that there is no space between /f1 and the file location.
5. Check if the patch installation was successful. To do this, open Eviews 8 and click on Help->About EViews. You should see that your Eviews 8 version is updated to July 11, 2013 build.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter any problems or errors during the patch installation, you can create a log file that records the installation process and outcome. To do this, add /f2 switch to your command line and 0f148eb4a0
